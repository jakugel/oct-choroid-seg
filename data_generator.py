        aug_mode: mode to use for augmentation

        none: no augmentations -> will just use what is in the images and labels arrays as is
        one: for each image, one augmentation will be picked from the list of possible augmentation functions
            chosen based on probabilities in aug_probs.
        all: for each image, all augmentations will be performed creating a new separate image for each

        note that for patch mode: augs are applied to the full size images before being broken into patches
        _________

        aug_probs: probabilities used for selecting augmentations in 'one' mode. Should be values between 0 and 1
        which add to 1.

        aug_fly: whether or not to perform all augmentations at the very start or to perform them each time the
        image is required.
        _________

        shuffle: whether or not to shuffle the order of the images at the start as well as at the end of each epoch
