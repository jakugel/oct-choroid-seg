* h5py
* Matplotlib

# Training a model (patch-based)
1. Modify *load_training_data* and *load_validation_data* functions in *train_script_patchbased_general.py* to load your training and validation data (see comments in code). [see example data file and load functions]
2. Choose one of the following and pass as first training parameter as shown in code:
    * *model_cifar* (Cifar CNN)
    * *model_complex* (Complex CNN)
    * *model_rnn* (RNN) [default]
3. Can change the desired patch size (*PATCH_SIZE*) as well as the name of your dataset (*DATASET_NAME*).
4. Run *train_script_patchbased_general.py*
5. Training results will be saved in the location defined by *parameters.RESULTS_LOCATION*. Each new training run will be saved in a new seperate folder named with the format: 
*<TIMESTAMP>_<MODEL_NAME>_<DATASET_NAME>*. Each folder will contain the following files:
    * *config.hdf5* (summary of parameters used for training)
    * *stats_epoch#.hdf5* (training and validation results for each epoch up to epoch #)
    * one or more *model_epoch&.hdf5* files containing the saved model at each epoch &
  
# Training a model (semantic)
1. Modify *load_training_data* and *load_validation_data* functions in *train_script_semantic_general.py* to load your training and validation data (see comments in code). [see example data file and load functions]
2. Choose one of the following and pass as first training parameter as shown in code:
    * *model_residual* (Residual U-Net)
    * *model_standard* (Standard U-Net) [default]
    * *model_sSE* (Standard U-Net with sSE blocks)
    * *model_cSE* (Standard U-Net with cSE blocks)
    * *model_scSE* (Standard U-Net with scSE blocks)
3. Can change the name of your dataset (*DATASET_NAME*).
4. Run *train_script_semantic_general.py*
5. Training results will be saved in the location defined by *parameters.RESULTS_LOCATION*. Each new training run will be saved in a new seperate folder named with the format: 
*<TIMESTAMP>_<MODEL_NAME>_<DATASET_NAME>*. Each folder will contain the following files:
    * *config.hdf5* (summary of parameters used for training)
    * *stats_epoch#.hdf5* (training and validation results for each epoch up to epoch #)
    * one or more *model_epoch&.hdf5* files containing the saved model at each epoch &
  
# Evaluating a model (patch-based)
1. Modify *load_testing_data* function in *eval_script_patchbased_general.py* to load your testing data (see comments in code). [see example data file and load function]
2. Specify trained network folder to evaluate.
3. Specify filename of model to evaluate within the chosen folder: *model_epoch&.hdf5*
4. Run *eval_script_patchbased_general.py*
5. Evaluation results will be saved in a new folder (with the name *no_aug_<DATASET_NAME>.hdf5*) within the specified trained network folder. Within this, a folder is created for each evaluated image containing a range of .png images illustrating the results qualitatively as well as an *evaluations.hdf5* file with all quantitative results. A new *config.hdf5* file is created in the new folder as well as *results.hdf5* and *results.csv* files summarising the overall results after all images have been evaluated.

# Still to be added
* *RNN bottleneck* and *Combined* semantic network models
* Code and instructions for preprocessing using contrast enhancement (Girard filter)
